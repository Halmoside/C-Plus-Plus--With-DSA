# Comparison of C and C++

## C Language (Old-School)

1. **Procedural Language** – Follows step-by-step instructions.  
2. **Function-based** – Uses functions to perform tasks.  
3. **Less Code Repetition** – No built-in OOP reusability.  
4. **Less Secure** – No access control mechanisms.  
5. **Fast** – Closer to hardware and faster execution.  
6. **Manual Memory Management** – Uses `malloc` and `free`.  
7. **Limited Library Support** – Only basic standard library available.  
8. **Use Cases** → OS development, embedded systems, system-level programming.  
9. **Code Complexity** → Simple but lengthy (No OOP features).  
10. **Supports Function Overloading** → ❌ No  
11. **Supports Operator Overloading** → ❌ No  
12. **Exception Handling** → ❌ No (Errors must be handled manually).  
13. **Programming Style** → Structured

## C++ Language (Upgraded)

1. **Object-Oriented + Procedural** – Supports both OOP and traditional C-style programming.  
2. **Object-based** – Uses objects & classes to manage code better.  
3. **More Code Reuse** – OOP allows reusing code with inheritance.  
4. **More Secure** – Encapsulation hides data and restricts access.  
5. **Slightly Slower** – Extra OOP features may reduce speed slightly, but still fast.  
6. **Manual & Automatic Memory Management** – Uses `new` & `delete`, plus smart pointers.  
7. **Rich Libraries (STL)** – Provides ready-made functions for sorting, searching, etc.  
8. **Use Cases** → Game development, GUI applications, software, AI, and system-level programming.  
9. **Code Complexity** → Organized & manageable (OOP makes large projects easier).  
10. **Supports Function Overloading** → ✅ Yes  
11. **Supports Operator Overloading** → ✅ Yes  
12. **Exception Handling** → ✅ Yes (Try-Catch makes error handling easier).  
13. **Programming Style** → Structured + Object-Oriented
