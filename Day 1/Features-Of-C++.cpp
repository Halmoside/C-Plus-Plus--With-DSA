// Features Of C++

// 1. C++ is called a middle-level language.
// Because it has features of both low-level and high-level programming languages.

// Low-Level Language (Close to Hardware)
// A low-level language is a programming language that is closer to machine code 
// (binary 0s and 1s) and directly interacts with the computer’s hardware. 
// It is fast and efficient but hard to understand and write for humans.

// Examples:

// 1. Machine Language (Binary Code)
// The actual instructions that a computer’s processor understands.
// Written in 0s and 1s (example: 10101000 11001001).
// Extremely difficult for humans to read and write.

// 2. Assembly Language
// Uses mnemonics (short words) instead of binary (example: MOV A, B to move data).
// Requires an Assembler to convert it into machine language.
// Slightly easier than machine code but still complex.
// Pros of Low-Level Languages:
// 1. Faster execution (direct hardware communication).
// 2. More control over memory and processing power.

// Cons of Low-Level Languages:
// 1. Hard to understand and write.
// 2. Not portable (code written for one CPU may not work on another

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// High-Level Language (Closer to Humans)
// A high-level language is a programming language that is easier to read, write, and 
// understand because it uses English-like words and symbols. However, it needs to be 
// translated into machine code using a compiler or interpreter before a computer can 
// understand it.

// Examples:
// C, C++ (mid-level, but mostly high-level)
// Python, Java, JavaScript
// C#, PHP, Ruby

// Example Code (Python vs. Low-Level Language)

// 1. Python (High-Level):
// print("Hello, World!")
// Easy to read and write for humans.

// 2. Assembly (Low-Level):
// MOV DX, OFFSET MESSAGE  
// MOV AH, 9  
// INT 21H  
// Much harder to understand than Python.

// Pros of High-Level Languages:
// 1. Easy to learn and write.
// 2. Portable (can run on different computers).
// 3. More efficient development (faster coding and debugging).

// Cons of High-Level Languages:
// 1. Slower than low-level languages (needs translation).
// 2. Less control over hardware and memory.

// 2. C++ supports principles of object oriented programming.

// 3. C++ joins three seperate programming traditions.
// --> the procedural language tradition, represented by C.
// --> the object oriented language tradition, represented by the class enhancements
//     C++ adds to C.
// --> generic programming, supported by C++ templates.
