# Facts About C++

## 1. C++ is an Extension of C
 C++ was originally called "C with Classes" because it extended the C language by adding  
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes and objects.

## 2. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
 C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs.  
 He wanted to make a more powerful language than C while keeping its speed and efficiency.

## 3. C++ is Both Procedural & Object-Oriented
 Unlike C, which is only procedural, C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming (OOP).  
 This makes it more flexible for different types of projects.

## 4. Used in High-Performance Applications
 C++ is widely used in game development, operating systems, browsers, financial systems, and AI because of its speed and efficiency.  
 Famous software like Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, and Amazonâ€™s website backend use C++.

## 5. C++ Introduced the Standard Template Library (STL)
 STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful feature of C++ that provides pre-built data structures like vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms.  
 It saves time and makes coding easier.

## 6. Memory Management with Pointers
 Unlike many modern languages, C++ gives full control over memory management using pointers, new, delete, and smart pointers.  
 This makes it both powerful and complex.

## 7. C++ is Super Fast
 C++ is one of the fastest programming languages, often used in real-time systems and performance-critical applications.  
 It is much faster than Python and Java in execution speed.

## 8. Backward Compatible with C
 A C++ compiler can run most C programs without modification, making it backward compatible with C.

## 9. C++ is Still Relevant in 2025 and Beyond
 Despite new languages like Python and Rust, C++ is still one of the top programming languages used in competitive programming, game engines, and system-level software.

## 10. C++ Powers Your Favorite Games ðŸŽ®
 Games like PUBG, Call of Duty, GTA V, and Assassinâ€™s Creed are developed using C++ because of its speed and control over hardware.

## Some More Facts

### 1. C++'s OOP aspect was inspired by a computer simulation language called simula67.
Simula 67 was the first true Object-Oriented language, and its ideas helped shape C++'s  
OOP features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Without Simula 67, C++ might not have been an OOP language at all.

### 2. Java was written in C++

### 3. Major OS are written in C++

### 4. C++ is world 4th most used programming language.
